//! # Shadow Terminal
//! A fully-functional, fully-rendered terminal purely in memory.
//!
//! Useful for terminal multiplexers (a la `tmux`, `zellij`) and end to end testing TUI
//! applications.
//!
//! There are 2 convenience modules for using this library: [`ActiveTerminal`] and
//! [`SteppableTerminal`]. The former is run in a thread and can only be interacted with through
//! channels, it's aimed more towards real world applications. Whilst the latter must be stepped
//! through and is aimed more at end to end testing.
//!
//! The underlying [`ShadowTerminal`] is also designed to be used directly, but requires a bit
//! more setup. See `ActiveTerminal` and `SteppableTerminal` to see how.
