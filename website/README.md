## Zola

The Tattoy website is built using the Zola static site engine.

To develop on the website:

1. [Install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
2. Clone the Tattoy git repo and enter the website directory:
   1. `git clone https://github.com/tombh/tattoy.git`
   2. `cd website`
3. Start the Zola server with `./ctl.sh serve`.

A local server should start and you should be able to access a local version of the website from [http://127.0.0.1:1111](http://127.0.0.1:1111).
