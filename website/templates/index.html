        About
      </h2>
      <p>
        Tattoy can generally be thought of as a framework for adding eye-candy to your terminal. It is purely
    text-based so works in any terminal emulator that supports true colour. "Graphics" is rendered with UTF8
    half-blocks (▀,▄). Whilst most of its effects are for getting you street credibility it also has more
    powerful features based around its awareness of terminal contents. For example it can detect and auto
    adjust text contrast whilst remaining faithful to the terminal's palette.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tattoy works with your existing shell, theme and prompt, etc. It can always and immediately toggle between
  its effects and your normal terminal state, allowing for easy copy-pasting for example.

        Shaders
      </h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps the fanciest feature of Tattoy is its ability to render GPU shaders. It is designed to be able to
  run most shaders from
        <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shader Toy</a>
        without any editing at all. It also supports
        <a href="https://github.com/hackr-sh/ghostty-shaders">Ghostty shaders</a>
        out-of-the-box, though certain 
    shaders that alter the position of text (such as CRT emulators) don't have a pronounced impact as text
    rendering is always left to the host terminal emulator.

        Second Terminal In Background

      <div class="home-feature-flex">
        <span class="home-feature__text">
          You can run an arbitrary command that is rendered in the background of your normal terminal. Use-cases for
  this might be:
          <ul>
            <li>
              an audio visualiser
            </li>
            <li>
              video background
            </li>
            <li>
              system monitor graphs
            </li>
          </ul>
          The background terminal's opacity can be adjusted so it doesn't visual conflict too much with your
        actual terminal.

          The minimap is a pixelised version of the contents of the scrollback, including the current contents
        of the screen. It live updates, even when using the so-called "alternate screen" for apps like `nvim`,
        `top`, `gitui`, etc.
          <p>
            Tattoy manages its own scrollback buffer (like say `tmux` does), and so can therefore also provide
          its own scrollbar.

        Auto Text Contrast
      </h2>

        <span class="home-feature__text">
          Have you ever run `ls` in a directory only for certain file types to be completely illegible? This has
        long been an intractable problem caused by the limited colours of terminal palettes. CLI applications
        are only ever aware of palette index values, not the underlying RGB value, therefore it is impossible
        for them to know if any given background colour is sufficient enough to allow its containing text to
        be readable.
          <p>Not anymore!</p>
          <p>
            Tattoy is aware of the true 24 bit RGBA value of all colours in your terminal. This allows it to use
        clever algorithms to detect low contrast text and auto adjust the foreground colour within the
        constraints of your chosen terminal theme to find the nearest colour that meets a minimum contrast 
        threshold.

          Plugins can be written in any language. You get full access to your terminal's contents and can render
        both UTF8 "pixels" and text to a dedicated plugin layer of your choosing. Currently the protocol is 
        JSON over `STDIN` and `STDOUT`. See the
          <a href="/docs/plugins">plugin documentation</a>
          for more info.
